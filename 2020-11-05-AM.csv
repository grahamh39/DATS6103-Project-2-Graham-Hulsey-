Protests Over Ballot Tallies Sweep Through U.S. Cities Protesters marched in several cities against President Trump. Some of his supporters gathered near a Phoenix building where votes were being counted. The Justice Department said it could send armed officers to ballot-counting locations. What are the remaining routes to victory? Use our interactive diagram to see. Trump Turns to the Courts The moves signaled President Trump’s determination to make good on his longstanding threats to upend any result not in his favor. Analysis: Win or Lose	 Trump Will Remain a Force Even if he is defeated	 he has made clear that he will not shrink from the scene. The Mood Inside Trump Headquarters After Fox Called Arizona for Biden The Associated Press also called Arizona for Joe Biden. The Times and CNN have not declared a victor there yet. Ritchie Torres and Mondaire Jones will become the first gay Black members of Congress. Listen to ‘The Daily’ Joe Biden won Michigan and Wisconsin and seems to be well placed in other key states. In Ascendant Night for Congressional Republicans	 Women Led the Way Republicans were on track to have the highest number of women ever to serve in their House conference. The Polls Underestimated Trump Again. Nobody Agrees on Why. No matter who wins	 the industry failed to fully account for the missteps that led it to miscalculate Donald Trump’s support four years ago. Tight Georgia Race Comes Down to Metro Atlanta President Trump held a narrow lead in the state as votes were counted in Atlanta	 where Joe Biden has made big gains in support. Pennsylvania Remains Up for Grabs Both sides are maneuvering for a possible ballot-by-ballot legal fight if the race is extremely close. Could Omaha swing the race? In 2020	 nothing is impossible.
